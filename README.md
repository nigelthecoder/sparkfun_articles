# sparkfun_articles
A series of articles on Arduino programming for the SparkFun blog.

The audience for these articles is engineers, tinkerers, students, who are already using
Arduino boards and have done some programming of the boards but who want to go faster, do something more 
challenging etc.

I do the work on a Mac so the main article is in a Pages file. I also try to remember to commit a Word version.
All the Arduino code work is done in the Arduino IDE or occasionally in Atom. I use PyCharm Ce for the Python code.
Graph plots etc are mostly done in Numbers. Some stats work is done in Gnu Octave (similar to MATLAB).
